      <br>
      <p>
        Unblocked Games 66 is a collaboration between me and a friend. It was officially introduced in early January 2022. 
        It is an Unblocked Games Website with numerous Unblocked Games to play at school or at home. We created this project for people
        who were bored in school and they had nothing to do (Ex. If they had study center but no homework). Especially with flash not
        being supported anymore, most of the unblocked games sites were useless.
